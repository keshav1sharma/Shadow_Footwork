# Shadow Footwork

Welcome to the documentation for the Shadow Footworks Project! This project aims to provide a real-time scoring system with sensors that accurately track and display player footwork speed, offering personalized feedback based on player performance. While inspired by the traditional 6 corner footwork practice, this project goes beyond the basics, providing additional features to enhance your training experience.

## Features

- **Scoring System:** The project incorporates sensors that capture footwork movements and calculate the player's speed. The real-time scoring system allows you to monitor your footwork performance instantly.
- **Multi-Level Practice:** The system offers three levels of difficulty tailored to different player skill levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. This allows you to challenge yourself and progressively improve your footwork skills.
- **Review System:** After each practice session, the project provides a review system that evaluates your performance based on the selected level. This feedback helps you understand how well you performed and identifies areas for improvement.

## Why is it Required?

Traditional footwork practice in badminton often relies on another person to track time and measure speed, limiting the ability to practice independently. This project addresses this limitation by providing a self-contained system that allows players to practice footwork anytime and anywhere. By eliminating the need for a dedicated timer or assistance from others, players gain independence and flexibility in their training routine.

## Hardware Requirements

To build the Badminton Footwork Practice Project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino Uno R3 (Quantity: 1)
- Red LED (Quantity: 12)
- Pushbutton (Quantity: 10)
- PCF8574-based 32 LCD 16 x 2 (Quantity: 1)
- 8 Pin Header (Quantity: 1)
- Piezo Buzzer (Quantity: 1)

Please refer to the documentation for detailed information on each component and where to purchase them.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Wire.h Library
- LiquidCrystal_I2C Library
